Technology and computers have always been something I am passionate about. 
I never thought I would take the path I am taking right now. I always thought I was going to be in a career that had to do with writing and literature. I loved to write in high school. My freshman through senior year, I was big on writing journal entries, writing posts on my blog, digging deeper into poetry. Writing was like my escape. As I continued writing, I decided to take my journal writes and blog entries to Tumblr. I always loved writing on there and then I noticed I could customize my blog more. That is when I first encountered - HTML, CSS, and javascript. I saw the lines of code and wondered what each line did. 


I began to play around with the code and started to pick up on super basic html. It was interesting to see how certain lines would add something to the blog page. That is where my passion for coding started. Once I dabbled into html and css, I noticed during my first year in community college, that code was my thing. Of course I ventured off and took different classes in community college that I thought would be IT (creative writing, journalism, public relations) They were not what I wanted to do and I found everything boring. At the time, I did not think of coding as a career because I always thought you had to be superior in math to make it in computer science and that scared me immensely. 
After constantly not liking the general education classes I was taking. I finally decided to give code a try. Looking back at my love for designing and customizing my tumblr page. I decided to look into web development, software engineering, front and back end developers. I fell into this endless amount of information about the different fields I could tap into. All of them requiring someone to know how to code and I wanted to be that person. I kept researching jobs around my area, watching YouTube videos of current software engineers, googling what it took to become a SE. It sparked something in me - that being that **I am going to be a software engineer**. 


I began taking courses online - codecademy, freecodecamp, and udemy. Those were the main sites I would look at when studying code. I then figured I needed to have more of a structure because I kept studying multiple programming languages yet never retaining much! Although I do have much coding experience coming into Flatiron, I still have much to learn and I feel as though I have wasted some time. I am excited about this journey and the challenges. Flatiron is definitely the best step towards my career and end goals.
