<p>Hello! My name is Adela, my nickname is "Addy". I live in Southern California. I am working part time to make ends meet. I decided to take this journey with Flatiron school to make a change in my life and become a software engineer. I have always had a love for code and tech! I actually started coding when I was in high school - editing my tumblr. I am taking the self paced course. </p>
